The yearly tournament was a go!

I won last year, so that meant I had to create and host it this year. We ended up doing a Super Bomberman elimination tournament on a Retro Pi that I put together. We had some glitches with the controllers, but eventually sorted them all out!

Lambeaus (Matt) ended up winning the entire thing after Phreak (Ryan) made a valiant effort coming all the way back from the losers bracket and winning game 1 of the finals, only to lose the second. Results are here.

As always, we ended the evening with some Rockband shenanigans, and Phreak fell asleep... again.
