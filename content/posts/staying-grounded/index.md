Played some FIFA 23 as it was added to Gamepass. Started a career as TJ Shaughnessy, right side midfielder. Scored a beauty! If the Xbox PC game captures worked better, I’d post em.  

Haven’t been posting much lately. Work keeping me busy. Been playing a lot of Grounded, even getting Lennon to play some. It’s such a fascinating game.
