Gonna try to digitize my gaming journal...  while there's something cool about having it handwritten in a book like I've done for a few years now... being able to link to shenanigans like what happened tonight is going to be interesting.

Warzone 2.0 Season 2 was tonight.  Played with SweatyBeachBall, and Lambeaus.  Good times!

[First Win of Season 2](https://youtu.be/wmpHrepjZ9s)...  barely.
