Another night of Warzone. This time with Kong, Lambeaus and SweatyBeachball.   

It did not go well.  I was definitely dead more than a live, and as a team I don't think we hit the top 10 once.  

I also played more Skyrim. Completed more of the Civil War Quest line...  my character is now much more of a pure caster than Shadowknight... I just don't have the points to do a Shadowknight build any kind of justice.  Especially since I'm doing a bunch of crafting skill too.
