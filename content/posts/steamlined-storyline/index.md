Still working my way through the Diablo 4 storyline. I finished Act 2 last night.  I'm skipping all the side quests and only doing story missions.  My assumption is once I've completed the story, and unlocked more of the Seasonal mechanics, I'll be able to go back and do the side quests.

I also found [this](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23973734/rules-of-engagement-classic-hardcore-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft) which has my interested piqued! The idea of permadeath with chracters adds to the challenge, and it adds to the interest for me.  Raised stakes!  Can't just bash your head against a wall till you make it through, cuz the wall will fall on you then you're dead!...  For good!
