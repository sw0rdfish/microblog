Wasn't really feeling like much of anything tonight, so I decided to boot up the old Master Chief Collection.  I had played through most of Halo Reach, but I had 4 or so missions left so I knocked them out and picked up some achievement points.

Love that game.  R.I.P. Noble Team!

105 Gamerscore while I was at it too. Good bonus!
