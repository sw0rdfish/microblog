Mostly been playing a lot of Grounded. I’ve been also playing some Dead Cells again to pass some gaming time.  

However, that’s all been a distraction for June 1st…. Diablo 4 is here! Some of my favourite games are the Diablo series, none more than D3. 

Played some Hardcore characters with The Fuzz on Early Access day. Had a couple hours since then to try out some other classes. Necromancer is the early favourite.
