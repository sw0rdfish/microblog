Started playing World of Warcraft hardcore...  I've got a few different classes going.  Alliance Dwarf Priest and a Horde Orc Hunter.  We're not gonna talk about the character we've already lost...  rip.

Starfield is out today, I've just barely got going. Made a charachter and checked out the first 10 minutes of the game. Looking forward to getting into it this weekend.

I've completely falling off Diablo 4...  it just wasn't grabbing me.  I'll be going back to it, but for now... I'm just at the gates of hell, with zero desire to walk through.
