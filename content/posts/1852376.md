Minecraft with Lennon in the afternoon. We started ANOTHER world. This time Survival with “no cheating”. I’ve declared I’m just gonna be a farmer, but the villager keeps stealing my crops! 

Lennon is so excited for the update next week she can’t contain herself. 

Getting closer to the last few Hades achievements too. Just gotta run into Sisyphus, Nyx and every Olympian one last time! 

Hades 2… I am ready!
