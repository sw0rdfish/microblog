So after a stop and start... due to schedule... **and** my usual "actually... I want to make a _this_ character!" and re-rolled a new charachter, I present to you,

Tag Buchanan, Space Pirate

I'm not sure what's up with these _CAN-uck_ products, but I'm collecting them all!

Not much to say about the game yet, there's lots to do, and lots of stuff to look at and mess with... I'm not sure I'm ready to praise it to Fallout 4, or Skyrim levels yet, but it sure looks pretty!
