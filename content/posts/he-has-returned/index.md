Been a few weeks since I've been able to game regularily.  Been sick a few times... not good! Really knocked me out flat!

I did manage to S-Rank Vampire Survivors ( again? ) they keep adding DLC to the game. So for now, I'm done.  I also started the Dawnguard DLC for Skyrim. So between those two games, and my illness, it's been a real back from the dead vibe around me.

Civ VI is out on Gamepass, so I put some hours into it.  Not sure if I'll keep going, feels WAY deeper than Civ V was, and I was never that into the depth of that game.  It's very good though.

Lambeaus, Niteside and myself did the Modern Warfare 2 first Raid episode tonight.  Was a lot of fun.  Took almost 2 hours though, I bet we could clear it faster next time. SO many enemies!  Challenging.
