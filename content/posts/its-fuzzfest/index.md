FuzzFest started last night...  Got in late so didn't play much.

Today's focus was finishing my Hades achievements... and I got them finished!

One of my favourite games ever...  I enjoyed every minute of it.  I'm gonna keep playing it to clear out non-achievement goals in the game.

Played some Warzone and had myself a game. Also started Tunic. Not sure how I feel about it.

Not much else for Day 2.

Attendees: The Fuzz, NiteSide, Lambeaus, SeaSquared, Phreak, Sunscorch, GangsterPirate, JohnPrivate
