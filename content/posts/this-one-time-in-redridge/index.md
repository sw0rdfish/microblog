Well, it was bound to happen!  I'm sure next time it might not end so well.

Priest was doing everything to survive, and I was doing everything to fail! Even looted mid battle!

In my defense, I had just moved my action bar around, and was REALLY under leveled for the area...  everyone else stayed calm and we all lived.  Had Heckinchonkr had died, I'm not sure anyone else would have lived.

Didn't realize it was recording my mic, sorry about the annoying AC!
